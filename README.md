# Time-Series Forecasting for Humanitarian Aid - ***model***

In this repository is possible to find the code built for the purpose of this project. The experiments conducted and the output were driven by the data gathered, through the use of two main technologies:
- `ARIMA - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average`: a statistical model which perfectly fits for time series analysis and predictions of futre points (forecasting)
- `TFT - Temporal Fusion Transformer`: attention-based Deep Neural Netwoek, optimized for multivariate time series forecasting.
